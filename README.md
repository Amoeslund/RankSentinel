# RankSentinel

RankSentinel detect players using lower ranked abilities and notifies them. Inspired by the legacy add-on [RankWatch](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rankwatch).

RankSentinel is a [spiritual successor to the now defunct GogoWatch](https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/RankSentinel/issues/5) and SpellSnob add-ons.

Legitimate Low-rank Abilities have been excluded; including All Heals, Rank 1 Frost Bolt, Rank 1 Earth Shock, Rank 1 Blizzard, etc.

## Reporting issues

Ability data comes from [Gogo's revised ability list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jtx1WyfChzACzh0WBWANtrqkRtS3D-zPWqs3eOnyVvY/edit?usp=sharing), please leave a comment for any ability data changes you have in mind.

[RankSentinel github issues](https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/RankSentinel/issues) and [CurseForge project comments](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ranksentinel) are a great location to report problems.
