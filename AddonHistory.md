# History

SpellSentinel comes from the troubled story of GogoWatch. SpellSnob was an attempt by `Epoch of Thought - Whitemane` to revive the abandoned GogoWatch addon, it was promptly removed when the lead developer staked claim to the code in CurseForge comments. Because the project was deleted, I was not aware of licensing conflict until [nihlolino](https://www.curseforge.com/members/nihlolino/projects) commented on SpellSentinel, which was also subsequently removed after contacting the lead developer on Discord.

## SpellSnob

Original README entry: SpellSnob was briefly available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/SpellSnob) but was removed for unknown reasons. All original credit goes to \<Epoch of Thought\> - Whitemane. In accordance with the original SpellSnob WTFPL, this project has been renamed SpellSentinel.

The original [SpellSnob](#spellsnob) code uploaded in [https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/SpellSentinel/commit/a3d4b20417e2b02efa2d14316d265b576bf6bca6].

SpellSentinel was a manual upload of the SpellSnob addon distrubution, which reportedly came from the latest [CurseForge release of GogoWatch](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gogowatch). After learning of this credit breach, SpellSentinel was removed from CurseForge listing and [project credit updated](https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/SpellSentinel/commit/da6e8266e4b12b7d4a3be1638eaa37aab36eac1f).

## [GogoWatch](https://github.com/Gogo1951/GogoWatch)

The `gogowatch` branch contains the latest official code, prior to [unapproved license change to ARR](https://github.com/Gogo1951/GogoWatch/commit/686aa1c68493654616a69c374aa04d1dadf3258b), which was from the lead developer reacting to SpellSnob. All Rights Reserved [carries very little weight](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/4403).

[Changing license and adding opinions](https://github.com/Gogo1951/GogoWatch/blob/686aa1c68493654616a69c374aa04d1dadf3258b/LICENSE#L3-L5) to existing [licensing is unlawful](https://blog.frankel.ch/on-opensource-licenses-changes/).

Gogo transfered CurseForge addon and Discord control to the lead developer and quit the game and addon development. See [Gogo and lead developer licensing disagreement](https://github.com/Gogo1951/GogoWatch/commit/686aa1c68493654616a69c374aa04d1dadf3258b) for more details.

In accordance with the MIT license this code stemms from and [Gogo's endorsement](https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/SpellSentinel/issues/5), this project will be updated and distrubuted on WowInterface to avoid CurseForge's All Rights Reserved conflict with the [now-deleted GogoWatch addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gogowatch).
